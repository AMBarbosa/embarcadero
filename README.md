ðŸŒ²ðŸŒ‰ Species distribution models with BART ðŸŒ‰ ðŸŒ²

*What's BART?* Bayesian additive regression trees (BARTs) are an exciting alternative to other popular classification tree methods being used in ecology, like random forests or boosted regression trees. Whereas BRTs fit an ensemble of several small trees each explaining smaller fractions of variance, and random forests fit large numbers of trees and average, BART starts by fitting a sum-of-trees model and then uses Bayesian "backfitting" to upweight models.
